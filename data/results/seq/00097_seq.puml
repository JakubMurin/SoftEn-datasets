== Analysis of Manufacturing Options ==
note right: CEIS now needs to determine how the Input Materials might be reduced
CEIS -> MaterialFlowMonitor: Request availability of input materials.
note right: Could include further metadata, e.g. quality thresholds, wear&tear, etc.
CEIS --> MaterialFlowMonitor: (2x FabricBlock1, 1x FabricBlock2, Deadline)
MaterialFlowMonitor -> CEIS: List of options for each input material procurable within deadline, with quality metric
note right: Quality metric is one-dimensional. NEW at 100%; UNUSABLE at 0%
MaterialFlowMonitor --> CEIS: (FabricBlock1: 90%; FabricBlock1: 86%; FabricBlock1: 70%; FabricBlock2: 70%; FabricBlock2: 95%)
CEIS -> CEIS:
note right: CEIS now knows about available materials
note right: CEIS adds alternatives to list of possibilities. The resulting possibilities are in list SUST-POSS
CEIS -> CostAnalyzer: Forach alternative: fetch economical, ecological and social costs
CostAnalyzer -> WISER: Request GHG impact of each possibility in SUST-POSS
WISER --> CostAnalyzer: GHG
CostAnalyzer -> ERP: Request costs for each possibility in SUST-POSS
ERP --> CostAnalyzer: Prices
CostAnalyzer -> CEIS: costs for each alternative
CostAnalyzer --> CEIS: [1:{(CO2eq: 33 kgCO2, Water: 300l), (Price), (ContributionLocalInitiatives: 60$)}, 2:{...}]
CEIS --> Shop: alternatives, costs

== Negotation ==
