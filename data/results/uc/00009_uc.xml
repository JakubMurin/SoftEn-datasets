    <name>Collect Environmental Sample</name>
    <description>UAV collects an environmental sample (e.g., air or water) and optionally performs a dynamic analysis. A targeted collection point can be either on the surface (e.g., water collection) or at a designated altitude (e.g., air sampling).</description>
