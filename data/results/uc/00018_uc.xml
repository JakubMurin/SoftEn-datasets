    <name>Loss of Signal</name>
    <description>Without an onboard pilot, there is a significant reliance on the command and control link, and a greater emphasis on the loss of functionality associated with lost of signal. This exception case occurs when such a loss of signal occurs. Most UAVs have some degree of onboard autonomy - varying between the ability to continue flight to the currently assigned waypoint, execute failsafe mechanisms, and/or complete an entire mission autonomously.</description>
