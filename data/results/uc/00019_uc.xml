    <name>Geofence Incursion</name>
    <description>
        A Geofence establishes a virtual boundary around a geographical location. Most UAV provide support for establishing a geofence based on GPS coordinates and maximum altitude. Geofences can be established over rectangular, circular, or polygonic regions of a map. If a UAV breaches its geofence then a failsafe mechanism will activate causing the UAV to RTL or LAND in place.
        In many cases, the UAV supports a measured response with at least two trigger points associated with[APPROACHING_GEOFENCE] and [GEOFENCE_BREACH].
