        <step id="S1">The UAV positions itself in tracking_position, i.e., in the near vicinity of the victim but not directly overhead.</step>
        <step id="S2">The UAV uses image capture and analysis to continually tag the victim in the image stream.</step>
        <step id="S3">Based on the UAV's position (pitch, roll, yaw), the onboard tracker continually calculates the relative position of the victim with respect to the UAV.</step>
        <step id="S4">The onboard tracker generates appropriate velocity vectors to fly towards the victim, without flying directly over the victim and maintaining victim_separation_distance and always flying at an altitude greater than minimum_altitude.</step>
        <step id="S5">The velocity vector is sent to the UAV's autopilot and executed to enable the UAV to track the victim.</step>
        <step id="S6">Steps 2-5 are repeated until the UAV receives a stop_tracking command.</step>
