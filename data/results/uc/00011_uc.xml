    <mainSequence>
        <step id="S1">The RPIC visually inspects all UAVs prior to takeoff to ensure their flight-worthiness.</step>
        <step id="S2">The RPIC checks weather conditions for visibility (3 miles), temperature (must be within operating range of the UAV), and other conditions such as wind and precipitation to ensure safe flight.</step>
        <step id="S3">For each UAV flying in FAA controlled airspace, DroneResponse prepares an authorization request containing the UAV's registration, flight time, and flight region.</step>
        <step id="S4">DroneResponse connects to an authorization service provider (e.g., AirMap) and requests authorization for a UAV's valid flight plan.</step>
        <step id="S5">The authorization service provider returns permission to fly, including airspace constraints such as altitude limits and no-fly zones.</step>
        <step id="S6">DroneResponse marks all airspace restrictions on the map. All subsequent flight paths are checked against these restrictions prior to, and during, each flight.</step>
        <step id="S7">DroneResponse establishes a geofence that matches the outer boundary of the region for which flight authorization has been received.</step>
