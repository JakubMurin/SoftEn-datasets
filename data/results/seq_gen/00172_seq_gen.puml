@startuml "Low Battery Use Case"

actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor "RPIC" as RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

RPIC -> DroneResponse: responds to `[LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]` alarm
DroneResponse -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: detects low battery event
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: raises alert
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> UI: displays alert
UAV -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: detects battery level below `[CRITICAL_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]`
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> UAV: activates failsafe mechanism
RPIC -> UAV: maintains visual line of sight
RPIC -> UAV: observes transition to RTL state
UAV -> RPIC: suspends mission if necessary
UAV -> RPIC: moves other UAVs if needed
