title "Low Battery Use Case"

actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor "RPIC" as RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

RPIC -> DroneResponse: responds to `[LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]` alarm
DroneResponse -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: detects low battery event
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: raises alert
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RPIC: displays alert in UI
UAV -> UAV: detects battery level below `[CRITICAL_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]`
UAV -> FailsafeMechanism: activates failsafe mechanism
RPIC -> UAV: maintains visual line of sight
UAV -> RPIC: transitions to RTL state
UAV -> RPIC: suspends mission if necessary
UAV -> RPIC: moves other UAVs if needed

RPIC -> RPIC: decides task cannot be continued
RPIC -> UAV: manually activates RTL
DroneResponse -> RPIC: assigns new UAV
RPIC -> RPIC: mission continues

RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RPIC: raises critical battery alarm
RPIC -> UAV: lands in place or activates RTL
