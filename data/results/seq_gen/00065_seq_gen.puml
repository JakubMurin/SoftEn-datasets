@startuml "Generate Flight Routes for Area Coverage"

actor "Drone Commander" as DC
actor "Semi-autonomous UAV" as UAV
participant "DroneResponse" as DR

DC -> DR: A user selects the feature to mark a region on the currently displayed map
DC -> DR: The user marks a polygon shape on the map
DR -> DR: DroneResponse analyzes the shape and size of the drawn polygon
DR -> DC: The polygon is viable for route generation
DC -> DR: The user specifies the number of UAVs (N)
DR -> DR: DroneResponse generates an efficient set of N flight routes
DR -> UAV: DroneResponse assigns the flight routes to N available UAVs
DC -> DR: The use case ends once flight routes have been generated and assigned
