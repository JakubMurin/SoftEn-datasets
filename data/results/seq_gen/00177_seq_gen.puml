RPIC -> DroneResponse: The RPIC deactivates the UAV's safety switch.
DroneResponse -> UAV: DroneResponse issues an arming command.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV executes all pre-arming tests.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV passes pre-arming tests.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV arms.
UAV -> Pilot: The UAV's status is set to MISSION mode (PX4=MISSION, Ardupilot=GUIDED/STABILIZED).
Pilot -> DroneResponse: The UAV's automated pilot notifies DroneResponse that the UAV is armed for flight.

alt RPIC fails to deactivate safety switch
    DroneResponse -> UAV: The UAV issues a warning sound and raises an error when the arming command is attempted.
    DroneResponse -> RPIC: The use case continues from Step 1.
end

alt UAV fails pre-arming tests
    UAV -> System: The system reports specific reasons for pre-arming failure.
    UAV -> RPIC: RPIC reactivates the UAV's safety switch.
    RPIC -> Technicians: A technician attempts to fix the root cause of the pre-arming failure (e.g., recalibrating the UAV).
    Technicians -> Technicians: If the technician fixes the problem, the use case restarts from Step 1.
    Technicians -> UAV: If the technician fails to fix the problem, the UAV is removed from service.
