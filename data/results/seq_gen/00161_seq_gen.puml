UAV -> UAV: "Detects and responds to\nloss-of-signal"
UAV -> UAV: "Detects lost communication\nwith GCS"
UAV -> UAV: "Activates failsafe\nmechanism and\nRTL at designated altitude"
DR -> DR: "Detects loss of signal\nevent for UAV"
DR -> DR: "Raises alert"
DR -> RPIC: "Displays alert in UI"
RPIC -> UAV: "Observes transition to RTL mode"
UAV -> UAV: "Suspends mission or\nmoves other UAVs\nout of the way"
