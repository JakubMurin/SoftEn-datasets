title "Sequence Diagram for Collect Environmental Sample Use Case"

actor "Semi-Autonomous UAV" as UAV
actor "Mission Operator" as Operator

UAV -> Operator: The UAV reaches the GPS coordinates\nof the first sample collection waypoint
Operator -> UAV: The UAV arrives at its designated\ncollection coordinates

activate UAV
UAV -> UAV: The UAV positions itself to collect a\nwater sample
UAV -> UAV: The UAV uses its onboard vision\ncapabilities to find an unobstructed route\nto the water
UAV -> UAV: The UAV begins its descent while using\nimage capture and analysis and altitude sensors\nto position itself correctly above the water
UAV -> UAV: The UAV activates its onboard collection device\nand collects a water sample
UAV -> UAV: The UAV lowers its collection apparatus\n(typically a rubber hose, powered by a pump)
UAV -> UAV: The UAV collects the water sample
UAV -> UAV: The UAV stores the water sample for carrying home
UAV -> UAV: Steps S1-S3 are repeated until all planned\n collection points have been visited or the UAV\n has used all of its collection resources
UAV -> UAV: The use case finishes when the UAV commences\nits flight home
deactivate UAV
