title "Low Battery Use Case"

actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

GCS -> RPIC: DroneResponse responds to `[LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]` alarm
RPIC -> RPIC: The runtime monitoring system detects a low battery event
RPIC -> RPIC: The runtime monitoring system raises an alert
RPIC -> RPIC: Alert displayed in UI for low battery warning

UAV -> UAV: Detects battery level below `[CRITICAL_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]`
UAV -> UAV: Failsafe mechanism activated (RTL or land in place)

RPIC -> RPIC: Maintains visual line of sight, UAV transitions to RTL state
UAV -> UAV: Suspend mission if necessary, move other UAVs

RPIC -> RPIC: RPIC decides task cannot be continued
RPIC -> UAV: Manually activates RTL
RPIC -> GCS: Assign another UAV with the task
RPIC -> GCS: New UAV assigned with the task

RPIC -> RPIC: No failsafe mechanism onboard UAV
RPIC -> RPIC: Raise critical battery alarm
RPIC -> UAV: Land in place or manually activate RTL
