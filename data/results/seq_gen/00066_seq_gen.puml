@startuml "Generate Flight Routes for Area Coverage"

actor "Drone Commander" as DC
actor "Semi-autonomous UAV" as UAV
participant "DroneResponse" as DR

DC -> DR: A user selects the feature to mark a region on the currently displayed map.
DC -> DR: The user marks a polygon shape on the map.
DR -> DR: DroneResponse analyzes the shape and size of the drawn polygon for feasibility of generating routes and accepts the polygon as viable for route generation.
DC -> DR: The user specifies the number of UAVs (N) that will participate in the mission.
DR -> DR: DroneResponse dynamically generates an efficient set of N flight routes that optimize coverage of the marked area while minimizing flight times.
DR -> DR: DroneResponse assigns the flight routes to N available UAVs.
DC -> DR: The use case ends once flight routes have been generated and assigned.

alt Instead of optimizing for area coverage
    DR -> DR: The algorithm optimizes the routes for a sampling mission.
    DC -> DR: The user specifies the number of samples (S) to be collected by each UAV.
    DR -> DR: The algorithm optimizes the flight paths such that S sampling locations are distributed as evenly as possible over the marked area, locations are clustered into N flight paths, and each UAV's flight path is optimized to reduce power consumption.
end

opt The user wishes to mark a search area that is not entirely covered by the currently displayed map view
    DC -> DR: If the search area is in the vicinity of the current map view, the user pans and rescales the map until the planned search area is encompassed by the view.
    DC -> DR: If the search area is not in the vicinity of the current map view, the user recenters the map by entering GPS coordinates.
end

opt The polygon is deemed infeasible for route generation
    DR -> DR: If the polygon has insufficient width or height, it is rejected.
    DR -> DR: If the polygon includes unsupportable indentations or appendages, these will be ignored during flight route generation, and an alert will be raised.
end

opt There are fewer than N UAVs available for assignment to the designated flight plans
    DC -> DR: The user reduces the number of designated UAVs to a number for which viable UAVs are available.
    DC -> DR: Alternatively, a technician activates and arms additional UAVs for inclusion in the mission.
