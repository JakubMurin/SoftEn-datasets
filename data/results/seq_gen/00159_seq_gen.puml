actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor "RPIC" as RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

RPIC -> UAV: The UAV is in flight
UAV -> UAV: Detects and responds to loss-of-signal
UAV -> UAV: Activates failsafe mechanism to RTL
UAV -> DroneResponse: Notifies loss-of-signal
DroneResponse -> RPIC: Displays alert in UI
RPIC -> UAV: Observes UAV in RTL mode
UAV -> ATC: Reserves airspace during RTL
