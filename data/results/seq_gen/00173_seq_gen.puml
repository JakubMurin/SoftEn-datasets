UAV -> DroneResponse: responds to `[LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]` alarm
DroneResponse -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: detects low battery event
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: raises alert
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> UI: display alert
RPIC -> UAV: observes transition to RTL state
UAV -> FailsafeMechanism: activates according to preconfiguration
RPIC -> UAV: manually activates RTL if necessary
UAV -> RPIC: move other UAVs if needed
