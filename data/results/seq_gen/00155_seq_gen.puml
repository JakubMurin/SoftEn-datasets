actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

UAV -> UAV: Detects and responds to loss-of-signal
UAV -> UAV: Detects loss of communication with GCS
UAV -> UAV: Activates failsafe mechanism and returns to RTL

DroneResponse -> DroneResponse: Responds to loss-of-signal event
DroneResponse -> DroneResponse: Detects loss of signal event
DroneResponse -> DroneResponse: Raises alert
DroneResponse -> RPIC: Notifies RPIC of loss-of-signal event

RPIC -> RPIC: Maintains visual line of sight with UAV
RPIC -> UAV: Observes transition to RTL mode
RPIC -> UAV: Suspends mission or moves other UAVs if needed
