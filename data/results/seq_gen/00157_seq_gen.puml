actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor RPIC as RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

UAV -> UAV: Detects and responds to loss-of-signal
UAV -> UAV: Detects loss of communication
UAV -> UAV: Activates failsafe mechanism
UAV -> RPIC: Notifies loss-of-signal event
RPIC -> RPIC: Maintains visual line of sight
RPIC -> UAV: Suspends mission or moves other UAVs
