@startuml "Low Battery Use Case"

actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor "RPIC" as RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

RPIC -> DroneResponse: responds to `[LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]` alarm
DroneResponse -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: detects low battery event
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RPIC: raises alert
RPIC -> UAV: notifies low battery warning
UAV -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: detects battery level below `[CRITICAL_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]`
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> UAV: activates failsafe mechanism
RPIC -> UAV: observes RTL state transition
UAV -> ATC: suspends mission if needed
ATC --> UAV: clears airspace if needed
