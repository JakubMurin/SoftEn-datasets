@startuml "Loss of Signal Sequence Diagram"

actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor "RPIC" as RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

UAV -> DroneResponse: The UAV detects and responds to loss-of-signal
DroneResponse -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: The runtime monitoring system detects the loss of signal event for the UAV
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Raise alert
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RPIC: Display alert in UI

RPIC -> UAV: RPIC maintains visual line of sight and observes RTL mode
UAV -> UAV: Activate failsafe mechanism and return to RTL

RPIC -> UAV: Suspend mission or move other UAVs if needed
