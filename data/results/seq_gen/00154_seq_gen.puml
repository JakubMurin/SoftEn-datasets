@startuml "Loss of Signal Sequence Diagram"

actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor "RPIC" as RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

UAV -> UAV: Detects and responds to loss-of-signal
UAV -> UAV: Detects loss of communication\nwith GCS
UAV -> UAV: Activates failsafe mechanism\nand returns to RTL

RPIC -> DroneResponse: Responds to loss-of-signal event
DroneResponse -> DroneResponse: Detects loss of signal event
DroneResponse -> DroneResponse: Raises alert
DroneResponse -> RPIC: Displays alert in UI

RPIC -> UAV: Maintains visual line of sight\nand observes RTL mode
UAV -> UAV: Suspends mission or moves other UAVs
