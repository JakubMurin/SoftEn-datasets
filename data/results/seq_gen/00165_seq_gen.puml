RPIC -> DroneResponse: Responds to `[APPROACHING_GEOFENCE]` alarm
DroneResponse -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Detects UAV approaching geofence
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Raises alert
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Cancels current flight route
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> UI: Displays geofence warning alert
UI -> RPIC: Notifies RPIC
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> UAV: Reroutes UAV
RPIC -> UAV: Issues new flight command

UAV -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Detects `[GEOFENCE_BREACH]`
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> UAV: Activates failsafe mechanism

RPIC -> UAV: Maintains visual line of sight
UAV -> RPIC: Completes RTL or lands
UAV -> UAV: Suspends mission or moves other UAVs

RPIC -> DroneResponse: Decides task cannot continue
DroneResponse -> RPIC: Assigns new UAV

RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RPIC: Raises `[GEOFENCE_BREACH]` alert
RPIC -> UAV: Lands UAV or activates RTL
