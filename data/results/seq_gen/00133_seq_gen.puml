title "Lease Airspace for Planned Flight Path"

participant "Semi-Autonomous UAV" as UAV
participant "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

UAV -> ATC: Calculate airspace needed
UAV -> ATC: Request permission to reserve airspace
ATC -> UAV: Determine airspace availability
ATC -> UAV: Reserve airspace
ATC -> UAV: Release previous airspace reservations
ATC -> UAV: Grant exclusive lease of airspace
UAV -> UAV: Complete action and repeat

group Error Steps
    ATC -> ATC: Find other reservations and restricted airspaces
    ATC --> UAV: Deny request and provide lists
    UAV -> UAV: Analyze lists and select alternative action
    alt Action is impossible
        UAV -> UAV: Pick new waypoint
        UAV --> UAV: Continue at step 1
    else Progress is possible
        UAV -> UAV: Decide on new action
        UAV --> UAV: Continue at step 1
    end
    alt UAV in the air
        UAV -> UAV: Request small airspace to wait
        UAV -> UAV: Wait and repeat request
        UAV --> UAV: Continue at step 3
    else UAV on the ground
        UAV -> UAV: Wait and repeat request
        UAV --> UAV: Continue at step 3
    end
end
