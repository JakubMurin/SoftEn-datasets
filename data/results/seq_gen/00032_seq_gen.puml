DroneCommander -> SemiAutonomousUAV: Firefighters request flight authorization
SemiAutonomousUAV -> SemiAutonomousUAV: UAVs are activated and armed
SemiAutonomousUAV -> SemiAutonomousUAV: The UAVs perform synchronized takeoff
SemiAutonomousUAV -> SemiAutonomousUAV: The UAVs use their onboard vision to create an initial mapping of the building
SemiAutonomousUAV -> SemiAutonomousUAV: The UAVs plan optimized and coordinated surveillance flights around the building
SemiAutonomousUAV -> SemiAutonomousUAV: Prior to each leg of the surveillance flight, each UAV leases the necessary airspace
SemiAutonomousUAV -> SemiAutonomousUAV: Each UAV performs image capture and analysis using thermal imagery
SemiAutonomousUAV -> SemiAutonomousUAV: Imagery from each UAV is continuously streamed and aggregated to create a current heatmap of the building
SemiAutonomousUAV -> SemiAutonomousUAV: Steps 4-7 are repeated throughout the fire event
SemiAutonomousUAV -> DroneCommander: The Incident Commander ends the mission once the fire has been controlled
