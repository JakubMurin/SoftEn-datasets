actor "RPIC" as RPIC
actor "Technicians" as Technicians

RPIC -> DroneResponse: The RPIC deactivates the UAV's safety switch.
DroneResponse -> UAV: DroneResponse issues an arming command.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV executes all pre-arming tests.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV passes pre-arming tests.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV arms.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV's status is set to MISSION mode (PX4=MISSION, Ardupilot=GUIDED/STABILIZED).
UAV -> DroneResponse: The UAV's automated pilot notifies DroneResponse that the UAV is armed for flight.

RPIC -> UAV: The RPIC fails to deactivate the safety switch
UAV -> UAV: The UAV issues a warning sound and raises an error when the arming command is attempted.
UAV -> RPIC: The use case continues from Step 1.

UAV -> UAV: The UAV fails to pass its pre-arming tests
UAV -> UAV: The system reports specific reasons for pre-arming failure.
UAV -> RPIC: The RPIC reactivates the UAV's safety switch.
Technicians -> UAV: A technician attempts to fix the root cause of the pre-arming failure (e.g., recalibrating the UAV).
Technicians -> UAV: If the technician fixes the problem, the use case restarts from Step 1.
Technicians -> UAV: If the technician fails to fix the problem, the UAV is removed from service.
