actor "Drone Commander" as DC
actor "Semi-autonomous UAV" as UAV

DC -> UAV: Firefighters request flight authorization
DC -> UAV: Activate and arm UAVs
DC -> UAV: Perform synchronized takeoff
UAV -> UAV: Create initial mapping of building
UAV -> UAV: Plan optimized surveillance flights
UAV -> UAV: Lease necessary airspace
UAV -> UAV: Perform image capture and analysis
UAV -> UAV: Stream and aggregate imagery to create heatmap
UAV -> UAV: Repeat steps 4-7
DC -> UAV: End mission once fire is controlled

UAV -> UAV: Detect possible victim\nat confidence level > 'ignore_level'
UAV -> DC: Raise alert and request confirmation
DC -> UAV: Inspect video stream
DC -> UAV: Plan and execute \nrescue mission
DC -> UAV: Reject candidate sighting
