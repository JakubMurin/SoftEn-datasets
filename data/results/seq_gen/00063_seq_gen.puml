"Mission Commander" -> "Semi-Autonomous UAV" : The UAV is assigned or assumes the task of tracking a person
"Semi-Autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-Autonomous UAV" : The UAV positions itself in tracking_position
"Semi-Autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-Autonomous UAV" : The UAV uses image capture and analysis
"Semi-Autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-Autonomous UAV" : The onboard tracker continually calculates relative position
"Semi-Autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-Autonomous UAV" : The onboard tracker generates velocity vectors
"Semi-Autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-Autonomous UAV" : The velocity vector is sent to autopilot
"Semi-Autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-Autonomous UAV" : Steps 2-5 are repeated
"Mission Commander" -> "Semi-Autonomous UAV" : stop_tracking command
