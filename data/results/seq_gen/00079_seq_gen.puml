title Collect Environmental Sample

actor "Semi-Autonomous UAV" as UAV
actor "Mission Operator" as Operator

UAV -> Operator: The UAV reaches the GPS coordinates of the first sample collection waypoint
activate UAV
activate Operator

UAV -> Operator: The UAV arrives at its designated collection coordinates
UAV -> Operator: The UAV positions itself to collect a water sample
UAV -> Operator: The UAV uses its onboard vision capabilities to find an unobstructed route
UAV -> Operator: The UAV begins its descent while using image capture and analysis
UAV -> Operator: The UAV activates its onboard collection device and collects a water sample
UAV -> Operator: The UAV lowers its collection apparatus
UAV -> Operator: The UAV collects the water sample
UAV -> Operator: The UAV stores the water sample for carrying home
UAV -> Operator: Steps S1-S3 are repeated until all planned collection points have been visited
UAV -> Operator: The use case finishes when the UAV commences its flight home

alt Air Sample
    UAV -> Operator: The UAV is tasked with collecting an air sample instead of a water sample
    else Perform Analysis
    UAV -> Operator: The UAV not only collects a sample but also performs onboard analysis
    UAV -> Operator: The UAV performs onboard analysis of the sample
    UAV -> Operator: Targeted pollutants are identified in the sample
end

opt Error Handling
    UAV -> Operator: The UAV is unable to find an unobstructed route to the water
    Operator -> UAV: Direct UAV to skip the current waypoint
    Operator <-> UAV: Identify an unobstructed route to the water
end
