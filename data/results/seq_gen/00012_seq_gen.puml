@startuml "Deliver item to a specific location"

actor "Drone Commander" as DC
actor "Dispatcher" as D
actor "Emergency Responders" as ER

DC -> D: The delivery UAVs are activated and armed.
DC -> D: The Drone Commander selects target GPS coordinates from a map.
DC -> D: The UAV requests flight authorization.
D -> ER: The DroneResponse commander issues a command to start the delivery mission.
ER -> D: The UAV performs synchronized takeoff.
ER -> D: The UAV flies to the target destination.
ER -> D: The UAV drops the item.
ER -> D: The UAV establishes a safe flying altitude and sets its target destination to its home coordinates, then flies to the target destination.
ER -> D: Once the UAV arrives at its home coordinates, it lands.

alt Instead of the operator entering GPS coordinates
    DC -> D: Instead of the operator entering GPS coordinates, the coordinates are generated by a UAV based on its onboard vision.
end

alt Instead of flying home
    DC -> D: Instead of flying home, the operator provides coordinates for an alternate safe landing location in the vicinity of the delivery.
end

alt Instead of using a map
    DC -> D: Instead of using a map, the operator manually enters GPS coordinates.
    D -> ER: The use case continues with step 3.
end
