@startuml "Generate Flight Routes for Area Coverage"

actor "Drone Commander" as DC
actor "Semi-autonomous UAV" as UAV
participant "User" as U
participant "DroneResponse" as DR

U -> DR: A user selects the feature to mark a region on the currently displayed map
U -> DR: The user marks a polygon shape on the map
DR -> DR: DroneResponse analyzes the shape and size of the drawn polygon
DR -> U: The polygon is accepted for route generation
U -> DR: The user specifies the number of UAVs (N)
DR -> DR: DroneResponse generates N flight routes
DR -> DR: DroneResponse assigns flight routes to N UAVs
DR -> U: Flight routes have been generated and assigned

alt Instead of optimizing for area coverage
    DR -> DR: Algorithm optimizes routes for a sampling mission
    U -> DR: User specifies number of samples (S) for each UAV
    DR -> DR: Algorithm optimizes flight paths for sampling locations
end

opt Search area not entirely covered by map view
    U -> U: User pans and rescales map
    U -> U: User recenters map by entering GPS coordinates
end

opt Polygon deemed infeasible for route generation
    DR -> DR: Polygon rejected if insufficient width or height
    DR -> DR: Unsupported indentations or appendages ignored
end

opt Fewer than N UAVs available for assignment
    U -> U: User reduces number of designated UAVs
    U -> U: Technician activates and arms additional UAVs
end
