actor "Drone Commander" as DroneCommander
actor "Semi-autonomous UAV" as SemiAutonomousUAV
participant "User" as User
participant "DroneResponse" as DroneResponse

User -> DroneCommander: A user selects the feature to mark a region on the map
DroneCommander -> User: The user marks a polygon shape on the map
User -> DroneResponse: DroneResponse analyzes the shape and size of the polygon
DroneResponse -> User: The polygon is viable for route generation
User -> DroneResponse: User specifies the number of UAVs (N)
DroneResponse -> DroneResponse: Generates N flight routes for coverage
DroneResponse -> SemiAutonomousUAV: Assigns flight routes to N UAVs
SemiAutonomousUAV -> SemiAutonomousUAV: Executes assigned flight routes
SemiAutonomousUAV -> User: Notifies completion of flight routes assignment
