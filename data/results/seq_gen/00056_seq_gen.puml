actor "Semi-Autonomous UAV" as UAV
actor "Mission Commander" as Commander

UAV -> UAV: Position in tracking_position
UAV -> UAV: Use image capture and analysis to tag victim
UAV -> UAV: Calculate relative position of victim
UAV -> UAV: Generate velocity vectors to fly towards victim
UAV -> UAV: Send velocity vector to autopilot
UAV -> UAV: Repeat steps until stop_tracking command

UAV -> UAV: Lose track of victim
UAV -> UAV: Attempt to re-tag victim
