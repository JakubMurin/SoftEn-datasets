RPIC -> DroneResponse: The RPIC deactivates the UAV's safety switch.
DroneResponse -> UAV: DroneResponse issues an arming command.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV executes all pre-arming tests.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV passes pre-arming tests.
UAV -> UAV: The UAV arms.
UAV -> AutomatedPilot: The UAV's status is set to MISSION mode
AutomatedPilot -> DroneResponse: The UAV's automated pilot notifies DroneResponse

RPIC -> UAV: The RPIC fails to deactivate the safety switch
UAV -> UAV: The UAV issues a warning sound and raises an error
UAV -> RPIC: The use case continues from Step 1

UAV -> UAV: The UAV fails to pass its pre-arming tests
UAV -> System: The system reports specific reasons for pre-arming failure
RPIC -> UAV: The RPIC reactivates the UAV's safety switch
Technician -> UAV: A technician attempts to fix the root cause of the pre-arming failure
Technician -> Technician: If the technician fixes the problem, the use case restarts from Step 1
Technician -> UAV: If the technician fails to fix the problem, the UAV is removed from service
