title "Low Battery Use Case Sequence Diagram"

actor "Ground Control System" as GCS
actor RPIC
actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

UAV -> DroneResponse: responds to [LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD] alarm
DroneResponse -> "runtime monitoring system": detects low battery event
"runtime monitoring system" --> RPIC: Raises alert

UAV -> "runtime monitoring system": detects battery level below [CRITICAL_BATTERY_THRESHOLD]
"runtime monitoring system" --> UAV: Activates failsafe mechanism

RPIC -> UAV: Observes transition to RTL state
UAV -> UAV: Suspends remaining mission
UAV -> RPIC: Optionally assigns another UAV with the task
