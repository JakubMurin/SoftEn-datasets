RPIC -> DroneResponse: Responds to `[APPROACHING_GEOFENCE]` alarm
DroneResponse -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Detects UAV approaching geofence
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Raises alert
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Cancels current flight route
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> UserInterface: Displays geofence warning
UserInterface -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Reroutes UAV or RPIC intervenes
RPIC -> UAV: Issues new flight command

UAV -> RuntimeMonitoringSystem: Detects `[GEOFENCE_BREACH]`
RuntimeMonitoringSystem -> UAV: Activates failsafe mechanism

RPIC -> UAV: Maintains visual line of sight
UAV -> RPIC: Completes RTL or lands
UAV -> UAV: Suspends mission or moves other UAVs

DroneResponse -> RPIC: Provides option to assign new UAV
RPIC -> UAV: Assigns new UAV, mission continues
