@startuml "Generate Flight Routes for Area Coverage"

actor "Drone Commander" as DC
actor "Semi-autonomous UAV" as UAV
participant "User" as U
participant "DroneResponse" as DR

U -> DR: A user selects the feature to mark a region on the currently displayed map
U -> DR: The user marks a polygon shape on the map
DR -> DR: DroneResponse analyzes the shape and size of the drawn polygon
DR -> U: The polygon is viable for route generation
U -> DR: The user specifies the number of UAVs (N)
DR -> DR: DroneResponse generates efficient set of N flight routes
DR -> DR: DroneResponse assigns flight routes to N available UAVs
DR -> U: Flight routes generated and assigned

alt Instead of optimizing for area coverage
    DR -> DR: Algorithm optimizes routes for a sampling mission
    U -> DR: The user specifies the number of samples (S)
    DR -> DR: Algorithm optimizes flight paths for sampling locations
end

opt Error Handling
    U -> DR: User wishes to mark a search area not entirely covered by map view
    DR -> U: User adjusts map view to encompass planned search area
    U -> DR: Polygon deemed infeasible for route generation
    DR -> DR: Polygon rejected if insufficient width or height
    DR -> DR: Unsupported indentations or appendages ignored
    U -> DR: Fewer than N UAVs available for assignment
    DR -> U: User reduces number of designated UAVs or activates additional UAVs
