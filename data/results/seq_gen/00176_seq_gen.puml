actor "Drone Commander"
actor "Semi-autonomous UAV"

"Drone Commander" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": Firefighters request flight authorization
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": UAVs are activated and armed
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": The UAVs perform synchronized takeoff
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": The UAVs use their onboard vision to create an initial mapping of the building
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": The UAVs plan optimized and coordinated surveillance flights around the building
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": Prior to each leg of the surveillance flight, each UAV leases the necessary airspace
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": Each UAV performs image capture and analysis using thermal imagery
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": Imagery from each UAV is continuously streamed and aggregated to create a current heatmap of the building
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": Steps 4-7 are repeated throughout the fire event
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": The Incident Commander ends the mission once the fire has been controlled
