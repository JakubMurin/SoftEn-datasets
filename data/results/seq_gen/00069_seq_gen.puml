@startuml "Generate Flight Routes for Area Coverage"

actor "Drone Commander"
actor "Semi-autonomous UAV"

"Drone Commander" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": User selects the option to mark a region and generate routes dynamically
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": User selects the feature to mark a region on the currently displayed map
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": User marks a polygon shape on the map
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "DroneResponse": DroneResponse analyzes the shape and size of the drawn polygon for feasibility of generating routes
"DroneResponse" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": Accepts the polygon as viable for route generation
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": User specifies the number of UAVs (N) for the mission
"Semi-autonomous UAV" -> "DroneResponse": DroneResponse dynamically generates an efficient set of N flight routes
"DroneResponse" -> "Semi-autonomous UAV": Assigns the flight routes to N available UAVs
"DroneResponse" -> "Drone Commander": Use case ends once flight routes have been generated and assigned
