@startuml "End Mission Sequence Diagram"

actor "Drone Commander" as DC
actor "Semi-autonomous UAV" as UAV

DC -> UAV: The mission is completed and UAVs are recalled home
UAV -> UAV: The system checks that all recalled UAVs have unique home coordinates
UAV -> UAV: UAVs each plan their own routes back to their unique home coordinates
UAV -> UAV: Each UAV leases airspace for the next leg of its planned route and awaits clearance
UAV -> UAV: Upon receiving clearance, the UAV flies to the target waypoint
UAV -> UAV: Steps S4-S5 are repeated until the UAV returns to its launch coordinates and lands safely

DC -> UAV: The mission commander decides to end the mission before the intended tasks are completed and recalls all UAVs back to their base
UAV -> UAV: While a UAV is returning to base, the mission commander assigns it a new task
UAV -> UAV: The END_MISSION command is cancelled for this UAV
UAV -> UAV: The UAV commences its new mission

UAV -> UAV: Multiple UAVs have been assigned the same home coordinates
UAV -> UAV: For any group of UAVs with home coordinates that violate minimum separation distance, the system removes the home coordinates for all except one of them
UAV -> UAV: UAVs without assigned home coordinates are assigned new in-air temporary coordinates
UAV -> UAV: UAVs with in-air home coordinates follow steps S3-S5 until reaching the in-air coordinates and then hover in place
UAV -> UAV: The Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) manually controls the landing of any UAV with in-air home coordinates
