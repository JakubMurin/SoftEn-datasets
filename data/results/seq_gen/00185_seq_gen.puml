actor "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" as UAV
actor "Air Traffic Control" as ATC

UAV -> DroneResponse: The UAV detects and responds to loss-of-signal
DroneResponse -> DroneResponse: The runtime monitoring system detects loss-of-signal event
DroneResponse -> RPIC: Alert displayed to notify RPIC
RPIC -> UAV: Maintains visual line of sight and observes RTL mode
UAV -> UAV: Activates failsafe mechanism for RTL
UAV -> ATC: Runs diagnostic and reserves airspace if signal is re-established
