title "Collect Environmental Sample"

actor "Semi-Autonomous UAV" as UAV
actor "Mission Operator" as Operator

UAV -> Operator: The UAV reaches the GPS coordinates of the first sample collection waypoint
Operator -> UAV: The UAV arrives at its designated collection coordinates
UAV -> UAV: The UAV positions itself to collect a water sample
UAV -> UAV: The UAV uses its onboard vision capabilities to find an unobstructed route
UAV -> UAV: The UAV begins its descent while using image capture and analysis
UAV -> UAV: The UAV activates its onboard collection device and collects a water sample
UAV -> UAV: The UAV lowers its collection apparatus
UAV -> UAV: The UAV collects the water sample
UAV -> UAV: The UAV stores the water sample for carrying home
UAV -> UAV: Steps S1-S3 are repeated until all planned collection points have been visited
UAV -> UAV: The use case finishes when the UAV commences its flight home

alt The UAV is tasked with collecting an air sample
    UAV -> UAV: The UAV not only collects a sample but also performs onboard analysis
    UAV -> UAV: The UAV performs onboard analysis of the sample
    UAV -> UAV: Targeted pollutants are identified in the sample
    UAV -> UAV: The UAV dynamically plans a new collection route
    UAV -> UAV: The use case resumes at Step S1 using the dynamically planned collection points
    UAV -> UAV: If no pollutants are identified in the sample, then the use case continues with Step S1
end

opt The UAV is unable to find an unobstructed route to the water
    UAV -> Operator: The UAV requests advice from the user
    Operator -> UAV: The user directs the UAV to skip the current waypoint
    Operator -> UAV: The user leverages the UAV's onboard camera controls to manually identify an unobstructed route
end
