        <step id="S5">User selects to view patient information.</step>
        <step id="S6">Rehab Support fetches a new AccessToken using RefreshToken if current AccessToken is about to expire.</step>

        <step id="S8">Patient view is rendered on the screen.</step>

        <step id="S9">User clicks to view certificate, which initiates a POST request to Web Certificate Service opening the result in an iFrame.</step>
        <step id="S10">Web Certificate Service validates AccessToken and creates a session.</step>
