    <name>Draft displaying the possible interAction of the L4 with the L3</name>
    <description>
        This diagrams to avoid putting too much load on the handset in LIMC. Latest phones and tablets are not always available. In general, electronic equipment is more expensive (~30%). If the L4 needs to be scaled up, political and financial constraints might prevent the purchase of high-end handsets. This PlanDefinition only allows the triggering of questionnaires for clinical interrogation, classification proposal, treatment proposal. Each questionnaire could have an Action.code so the formfiller application may organize/group the questionnaire.
