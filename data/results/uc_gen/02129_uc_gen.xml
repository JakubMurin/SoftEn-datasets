        <step id="S4">Alice revokes a claim, sending a revoke claim message to Alice's Cloud Agent.</step>
        <step id="S5">Alice's Cloud Agent forwards the revoke claim message to the Issuers.</step>
        <step id="S6">Issuer verifies Alice's identity and revokes the claim by updating the non-revocation accumulator on the Ledger.</step>
