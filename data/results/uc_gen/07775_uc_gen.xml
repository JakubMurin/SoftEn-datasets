<useCase id="UC1">
    <name>Perform Build and Sync Build Data</name>
    <description>This use case involves Bob pushing a commit to the master branch, triggering the build pipeline on the GitHub repository named "Awesome pipeline". After the build is completed successfully, the Sync pipeline within the Buildkite tool is triggered. This pipeline generates the integration_config.yml file and runs the sync command.</description>
