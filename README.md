# SoftEn-datasets

**Objective**  
Creation of a dataset or several datasets for the selected task or tasks of software engineering

**Anotation**  
In the software engineering area there is a lot of research on effective methods for transformation of some artifacts created within the software development process into other software development artifacts. Despite these efforts, there often are not appropriate datasets available for evaluating the researched methods. Methods are therefore being evaluated on non-transparent data in small volumes, if they are even evaluated at all. Different methods for solving a task are therefore difficult to compare. An example of such a task is tranformation of use cases into UML diagrams into source code.
