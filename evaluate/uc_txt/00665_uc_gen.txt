2. User clicks the submit button.
3. Frontend sends a POST request to API Gateway (/api/match/submit) with payload containing user and selected difficulty.
4. API Gateway forwards the request to Matching Service Controller.
5. Matching Service Controller processes the request, passes it to the Matching Service, and stores the match request.
6. Matching Service creates a MatchRequest object and saves it to the MatchRequests collection in the Matching Database.
7. Matching Service generates a request identifier (requestId).
8. Matching Service Controller responds with a 200 OK status to API Gateway along with the requestId.
