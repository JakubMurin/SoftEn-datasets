1. CPS computes the delivery graph by sending a request to CityMap.
2. CityMap initializes data structures for mappedRoutes.
3. CityMap retrieves startWaypoint intersection for each point in the request.
4. CityMap initializes arrays predecessors and durations.
5. CityMap adds startWaypoint intersection to greys.
6. CityMap finds the minimal grey intersection and processes its neighbours.
7. CityMap updates durations and predecessors arrays based on street sections.
8. CityMap updates data structures based on the intersection type.
9. CityMap stores the processed intersection as a black intersection.
10. CityMap creates the DeliveryGraph with the computed mappedRoutes.
