1. GameEngine requests boundary from GameBoundaryDelegate.
2. GameBoundaryDelegate retrieves boundary object.
3. GameEngine triggers onCollision event with boundary and delta time on Ball.
4. Ball processes collision and retrieves safe position from boundary.
5. Ball triggers onCollision event with collision point, delta time, and restitution coefficient on FreeBody.
