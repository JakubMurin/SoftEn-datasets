1. Caller computes the delivery graph by sending a DeliveryRequest to CityMap.
2. CityMap initializes a TreeMap to store mapped routes.
3. CityMap iterates over waypoints in the request.
4. CityMap retrieves the start waypoint intersection.
5. CityMap initializes arrays for predecessors and durations.
6. CityMap adds the start waypoint intersection to the grey set.
7. CityMap finds the minimal grey intersection.
8. CityMap retrieves neighbour intersections of the minimal grey intersection.
9. CityMap checks if the successor intersection is not in the black set.
10. CityMap gets the street section between intersections.
11. CityMap updates durations and predecessors arrays.
12. CityMap removes the successor from the white set and adds it to the grey set.
13. CityMap removes the minimal grey intersection from the grey set.
14. CityMap puts the minimal grey intersection in the black set.
15. CityMap uses predecessors array to fill mapped routes.
16. DeliveryGraph is created with the mapped routes.
17. CityMap sends the delivery graph back to the Caller.
