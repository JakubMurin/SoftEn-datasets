1. Customer Requests to verify booking by OTP through UI.
2. UI Sends GET request /bookings/{bookingId}/verify-otp to BookingRouter.
3. Router invokes method verifyBookingOTP(bookingId, otp) on BookingController.
4. Controller fetches booking details using getBookingDetails(bookingId) from Repository.
5. Repository queries and retrieves booking data by ID and sends it back.
6. Controller verifies the OTP using the OTPService and decides.
7. If OTP is valid, updates booking status to "verified" in DB.
8. If OTP is invalid, delivers error response to UI.
