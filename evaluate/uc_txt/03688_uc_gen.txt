1. CPS computes the delivery graph by sending a request to CM.
2. CM initializes a TreeMap to store mapped routes.
3. For each waypoint in the request, CM retrieves the start waypoint intersection from SWP.
4. CM initializes arrays to store predecessors and durations.
5. CM adds the start waypoint intersection to the greys set.
6. CM finds the minimal grey intersection and updates predecessors and durations arrays.
7. For each neighbor intersection of the minimal grey intersection, CM retrieves the ID.
8. If the neighbor intersection is not in blacks set, CM gets the street section and updates arrays.
9. If the neighbor intersection is in whites set, CM removes it from whites and adds it to greys.
10. CM removes the minimal grey intersection from greys set.
11. CM retrieves the minimal grey intersection ID from MGI.
12. CM adds the minimal grey intersection to blacks set.
13. CM creates the delivery graph DG with the mapped routes.
14. CM sends the delivery graph back to CPS.
