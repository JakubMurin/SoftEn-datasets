1. The attacker initiates the length extension attack at the SHA1 hash algorithm.
2. The attacker extracts the message for manipulation.
3. The message is parsed successfully by the Message Extraction Facility.
4. The attacker computes the necessary SHA1 padding for the manipulated message.
5. The attacker attempts to tamper with the parsed message.
6. The attacker converts the hexadecimal to bytes fraction.
7. The attacker extracts the SHA1 internal state.
8. The attacker repetitively initializes a loop based on differing key lengths.
9. The attacker generates mac value for a distinct key length.
10. The server performs a validation on the new MAC with the hashed key-message concatenation.
11. Based on the comparison of system generated + message content - server returns conditional upon acceptance graphic.
