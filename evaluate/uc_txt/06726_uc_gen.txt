1. The attacker performs a length extension attack at SHA1.
2. The attacker extracts the message.
3. The extracted message is returned.
4. The attacker computes SHA1 padding for the message.
5. The padded message is returned.
6. The attacker tampers the message and tries.
7. The message's MAC in byte format is obtained.
8. Internal state of SHA1 is extracted from the MAC.
9. The attacker attempts to hash the message varying key lengths.
10. The new MAC is generated.
11. The server validates the new MAC.
12. The server's key is prepended to the message.
13. The combined key and message are hashed.
14. The server confirms if the hash equals the new MAC.
