1. User initiates the task "programuj pomodoro" using the CLI.
2. TaskStartHandler registers the new task.
3. TaskStartHandler saves the new task "programuj pomodoro" with start date and other details in the sqlite database.
4. TimeTrigger triggers a screen refresh.
5. Renderer retrieves tasks from the sqlite database.
6. Renderer renders a progress bar with animations and unicorns for the user.
7. TimeTrigger triggers TaskStateChangeHandler for state update.
8. TaskStateChangeHandler saves the new state as resting and increments the rest marker if work mode finishes.
9. TaskStateChangeHandler triggers a sound notification using NotificationPlayer.
10. If work mode finishes and resting mode starts, saving new state as resting and triggering notification occurs.
11. If deep rest mode finishes, task is marked as paused, and a sound notification is triggered.
12. TimeTrigger may eventually trigger Renderer to display the finish message with unicorns.
