1. The mission is completed and UAVs are recalled home.
2. The system checks that all recalled UAVs have unique home coordinates.
3. UAVs each plan their own routes back to their unique home coordinates.
4. Each UAV leases airspace for the next leg of its planned route and awaits clearance.
5. Upon receiving clearance, the UAV flies to the target waypoint.
6. Steps S4-S5 are repeated until the UAV returns to its launch coordinates and lands safely.
