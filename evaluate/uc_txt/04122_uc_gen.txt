1. User runs the system by providing input text.
2. ReflectiveAndRefinementAgent retrieves relevant memories based on the input text.
3. Agent interacts with LLM to get a response.
4. Agent decides to use a tool, Registry executes the tool, and relevant observations are made and saved in memory.
5. In case agent decides not to use a tool, the interactions are saved in episodic memory.
6. If the reflection phase is triggered, ReflectionLLM triggers reflection and RefinementLLM triggers refinement, and the results are saved in semantic and procedural memories.
