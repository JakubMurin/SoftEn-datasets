1. A user selects the feature to mark a region on the currently displayed map.
2. The user marks a polygon shape on the map.
3. DroneResponse analyzes the shape and size of the drawn polygon for feasibility of generating routes and accepts the polygon as viable for route generation.
4. The user specifies the number of UAVs (N) that will participate in the mission.
5. DroneResponse dynamically generates an efficient set of N flight routes that optimize coverage of the marked area while minimizing flight times.
6. DroneResponse assigns the flight routes to N available UAVs.
7. The use case ends once flight routes have been generated and assigned.
