1. Compute Delivery Graph by mapping routes for each start waypoint in the request.
2. Get the intersection for the start waypoint.
3. Initialize predecessors and durations arrays.
4. Add start waypoint intersection to greys set.
5. Find minimal grey intersection.
6. Get neighbour intersections of minimal grey intersection.
7. Get street section and release it.
8. Check if successor intersection is in whites set.
9. Remove minimal grey intersection from greys set.
10. Update blacks set with minimal grey intersection.
11. Create DeliveryGraph with mappedRoutes.
