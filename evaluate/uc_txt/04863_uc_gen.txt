1. User Agent sends a login request containing username, password, and CSRF token to the Login API.
2. Login API validates the received login request from the User Agent.
3. If the validation fails, Login API returns an appropriate status code to the User Agent indicating failure.
4. If the validation succeeds, Login API fetches user information (ID, role, password hash, salt) from the User database.
5. If user information exists in the database and authentication against the password hash succeeds, Login API returns an HTTP 200 OK response and sets an encrypted session cookie.
6. If authentication fails or user information is not found in the database, Login API returns an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response without disclosing the reason.
