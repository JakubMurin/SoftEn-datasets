1. The UAV arrives at its designated collection coordinates.
2. The UAV positions itself to collect a water sample.
3. The UAV uses its onboard vision capabilities to find an unobstructed route (e.g., free of tree branches) to the water.
4. The UAV begins its descent while using image capture and analysis and altitude sensors to position itself correctly above the water.
5. The UAV activates its onboard collection device and collects a water sample.
6. The UAV lowers its collection apparatus (typically a rubber hose, powered by a pump).
7. The UAV collects the water sample.
8. The UAV stores the water sample for carrying home.
9. Steps S1-S3 are repeated until all planned collection points have been visited or the UAV has used all of its collection resources.
10. The use case finishes when the UAV commences its flight home.
