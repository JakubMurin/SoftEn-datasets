1. The attacker performs a length extension attack at SHA1.
2. The attacker extracts the message.
3. The attacker computes SHA1 padding for the extracted message.
4. The attacker tampers with the message.
5. The attacker extracts the SHA1 internal state.
6. The attacker hashes the message with different key lengths.
7. The server validates the MAC of the new message.
8. The server prepends the server key to the message.
9. The server hashes the key with the new message.
10. The server checks if the hashed server key matches the new MAC.
11. The attacker breaks the loop and returns true if the server reply is true.
12. The attacker returns false if no suitable key length is found.
