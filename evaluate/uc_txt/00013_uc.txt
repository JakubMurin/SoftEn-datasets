1. If the camera is not activated, the UAV activates it.
2. Whilst in flight, the UAV streams imagery to its onboard companion computer.
3. Onboard compute processes streamed imagery and annotates objects of interest to depict their bounding boxes and confidence scores.
4. When an object is detected with confidence greater than the current [VisionDetection_Threshold] value, an event is raised and forwarded to the DroneResponse Event Manager.
5. All collected image streams (with and without annotations) are transmitted to the videostream server.
6. Steps 2-5 are continually repeated until the UAV is commanded to stop collecting imagery.
