1. CPS computes delivery graph by sending a request to CM.
2. CM initializes mappedRoutes.
3. For each startPoint in request, CM gets startWaypointIntersection from SWP.
4. CM initializes predecessors, durations arrays, and adds startWaypointIntersection to greys.
5. While greys is not empty, CM finds minimalGreyIntersection.
6. For each successor of minimalGreyIntersection, CM gets successorId from S.
7. If successorId is not in blacks, CM gets streetSection, updates arrays, and adds successor to greys.
8. CM removes minimalGreyIntersection from greys and adds it to blacks.
9. CM uses predecessors array to fill mappedRoutes.
10. CM creates DeliveryGraph with mappedRoutes.
11. CPS receives deliveryGraph from CM.
