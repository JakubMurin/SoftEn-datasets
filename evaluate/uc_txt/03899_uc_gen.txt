1. Token Owner inputNotes.
2. Token Owner executes JoinSplitProof passing the inputNotes, [], senderAddress, publicAmount, and tokenOwner.
3. Token Owner encodes the proof with assetAddress.
4. ACE executes publicApprove for assetAddress, proof.hash, and withdrawalAmount.
5. Token Owner constructs proof signatures for assetAddress and InputNotePrivateKey.
6. zero-knowledge asset carries out confidentialTransfer with proofData and proofSignatures.
7. ACE updates Note Registry with proofId, proofOutput, and assetContractAddress.
8. Note Registry updates ERC20 Token, transferring tokenOwner amount.
