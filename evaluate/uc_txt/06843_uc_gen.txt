3. API Gateway forwards the request to Dataset Management Service to fetch the properties of the dataset using fetchDatasetProperties(id) operation.
4. Dataset Management Service retrieves the dataset type from Dataset Type Registry by calling getDatasetType(datasetId) operation.
5. Dataset Management Service gets the properties of the dataset instance from Dataset Instance by using getProperties(datasetType) operation.
6. Dataset Management Service provides the dataset properties to API Gateway.
7. API Gateway shows the updatable properties to the User Interface.
8. User Interface displays the properties to the user for exploration.
