1. The DatasetDeveloper requests an upgrade check for a dataset instance with a new version to the Dataset Version Control.
2. The Dataset Version Control retrieves dataset type information for the new version from the Dataset Registry.
3. The Dataset Version Control gets existing version details for the dataset instance from the Dataset Instance.
4. The Dataset Version Control compares the dataset type details with the existing version details.
5. The Dataset Version Control retrieves upgrade compatibility rules for the dataset type from the Dataset Registry.
6. The Dataset Version Control applies compatibility rules to determine upgrade compatibility.
7. If the upgrade is compatible, the Dataset Version Control notifies the DatasetDeveloper and proceeds with the upgrade process.
