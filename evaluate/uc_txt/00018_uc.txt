4. DroneResponse responds to the loss-of-signal event.
5. The runtime monitoring system detects the loss of signal event for the UAV.
6. The runtime monitoring system raises an alert.
7. The alert is displayed in the UI to notify the RPIC of the loss-of-signal event.

9. If necessary, the UAV suspends the remainder of its mission or moves other UAVs out of the way of the returning UAV.
