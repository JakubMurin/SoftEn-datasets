1. DroneResponse decomposes the entire flight path into a series of flight legs, each one with its own target waypoint.
2. DroneResponse establishes an initial altitude of the flight and assigns it as the starting altitude of each individual leg.
3. DroneResponse checks the starting flight leg to ensure that it does not pass through any prohibited airspace whilst maintaining its starting altitude.
4. DroneResponse uses a terrain map to check the altitude of the flight leg's terrain to ensure that the UAV maintains minimum terrain separation whilst maintaining the starting altitude of the current leg.
5. Steps 3-4 are repeated for each flight leg.
6. Given the flight plan, the UAV checks that it has sufficient battery power to reach its destination and determines that it has sufficient power to continue.
7. The UAV leases airspace for the current flight leg.
8. The UAV ascends or descends to the target altitude of the current flight leg.
9. The UAV flies to the destination waypoint of the current flight leg.
10. The UAV reports its arrival at the flight leg's destination waypoint.
11. Steps 6-8 are repeated until the UAV reaches its final destination.
12. The use case finishes when the UAV assumes the task assigned for it to do at its final destination.
