1. The UAV positions itself in tracking_position, i.e., in the near vicinity of the victim but not directly overhead.
2. The UAV uses image capture and analysis to continually tag the victim in the image stream.
3. Based on the UAV's position (pitch, roll, yaw), the onboard tracker continually calculates the relative position of the victim with respect to the UAV.
4. The onboard tracker generates appropriate velocity vectors to fly towards the victim, without flying directly over the victim and maintaining victim_separation_distance and always flying at an altitude greater than minimum_altitude.
5. The velocity vector is sent to the UAV's autopilot and executed to enable the UAV to track the victim.
6. Steps 2-5 are repeated until the UAV receives a stop_tracking command.
