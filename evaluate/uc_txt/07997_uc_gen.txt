1. Developer requests Custom Operation (Compaction/Rebalance) from Dataset Management System.
2. Dataset Management System determines Operation Support.
3. Dataset Type Interface invokes Custom Operation.
4. Specific Dataset Implementation validates Operation.
5. Specific Dataset Implementation executes Operation on Dataset in DataSetDB.
6. Operation success/failure status is returned from DataSetDB to Specific Dataset Implementation.
7. Status is returned from Specific Dataset Implementation to Dataset Type Interface.
8. Execution confirmation and status are sent from Dataset Type Interface to Dataset Management System.
9. Operation Completion Notification is sent from Dataset Management System to Developer.
