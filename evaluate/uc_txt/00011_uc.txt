1. The RPIC visually inspects all UAVs prior to takeoff to ensure their flight-worthiness.
2. The RPIC checks weather conditions for visibility (3 miles), temperature (must be within operating range of the UAV), and other conditions such as wind and precipitation to ensure safe flight.
3. For each UAV flying in FAA controlled airspace, DroneResponse prepares an authorization request containing the UAV's registration, flight time, and flight region.
4. DroneResponse connects to an authorization service provider (e.g., AirMap) and requests authorization for a UAV's valid flight plan.
5. The authorization service provider returns permission to fly, including airspace constraints such as altitude limits and no-fly zones.
6. DroneResponse marks all airspace restrictions on the map. All subsequent flight paths are checked against these restrictions prior to, and during, each flight.
7. DroneResponse establishes a geofence that matches the outer boundary of the region for which flight authorization has been received.
